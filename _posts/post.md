#  PROlOGUE


      Murderers, minds of mass destruction with disgusting vile temptations, some reckless, others contempt  – most premeditated, but accidents happen. 

      This is how the world views these people – as if they aren't human, as if they’re creatures meant to be cast out of humanity – but no, these are people with disorders that never got the proper attention they deserved, these are people who are in terrible situations you can't understand, these are normal people who Crack under pressure, these are people who serve their nation. And this is who we all are at heart. We're all Murderers, it just takes one bad day and you're someone you thought you'd never be.

      Have fun, you're no longer human; according to society, you're a monster. Congratulations! Put on a smile, Put on your happy face – it's your big debut. The trauma is done and you can never go back.

      The apple was bitten. Your only choices are to finish the unwashed trauma apple and accept your inevitable fate, or to ignore it as the flesh of your humanity continuously rots into insanity, until it is no longer palatable, until you're so vile  that eating the truth could take your life.

       It did mine – after what I did my life is surely ruined.  I feel the guilt run from my heart to my lungs, I say aloud, “Am I satisfied?” They’re gone now, I did a terrible thing all for my own selfish desire, I was never murderous, I was never violent; I was ambitious and passionate for my craft.

      I didn't know one bad day, one crack in the frame, could break the  mirror and distort my image from human to monster unrecognisable to its origin. If I told myself a year ago that this would happen, he wouldn't believe me – he would thank me for the idea, write it down, and then tell me to stop lying. And the funny thing is, he wouldn’t even question that I was him from the future; if anything, he would use it as material for a book.

        I would have never imagined these events would ever play out; yet, after all this recollection, all i feel is Hate.
